# Qwen2 7B Fine Tuned Test
This repo contains a demo of the fine-tuned Vision Language Model trained on our custom dataset of Roblox avatars. 
The example is based off of https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/fine_tuning_vlm_trl 

# Notes
The performance (~56% accuracy) is not too good due to it being a test run to see if our dataset could interface with various models.
